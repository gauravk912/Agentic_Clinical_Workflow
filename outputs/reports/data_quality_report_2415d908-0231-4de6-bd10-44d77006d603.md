# Data Quality Report

**Status:** `WARN`

## Overview
- The dataset contains 299 rows and 13 columns with no missing values or duplicate rows, indicating good completeness.
- Overall, the data types are appropriate and consistent, with all columns numeric and no impossible values detected.

## Column-level checks
- No missing values detected in any column.
- Numeric columns such as `age`, `creatinine_phosphokinase`, `ejection_fraction`, `platelets`, `serum_creatinine`, and `serum_sodium` have some outliers detected:
  - `creatinine_phosphokinase` has 29 outliers (approx. 9.7% of rows), which is notable given the high max value (7861).
  - `serum_creatinine` has 29 outliers, indicating some extreme values.
  - `platelets` has 21 outliers, which may affect model robustness.
  - `ejection_fraction` and `serum_sodium` have fewer outliers (2 and 4 respectively), less concerning but worth monitoring.
- No impossible values were found in any columns.

## Row-level anomalies
- IsolationForest anomaly detection flagged approximately 10% of rows as anomalous.
- This suggests the presence of unusual or rare patterns in the data that could impact model performance if not addressed.

## Recommendation
- Proceed with modeling but with caution due to the moderate number of outliers and row-level anomalies.
- Investigate and potentially cap or transform outlier values in `creatinine_phosphokinase`, `serum_creatinine`, and `platelets` to reduce their impact.
- Consider robust scaling or outlier-resistant algorithms to mitigate effects of extreme values.
- For row-level anomalies, review flagged records to understand if they represent data errors or rare but valid cases; decide whether to exclude or weight them differently.
- Maintain current data types as they are appropriate; no changes needed.

## Issues
- Moderate number of outliers in key numeric columns (`creatinine_phosphokinase`, `serum_creatinine`, `platelets`).
- Approximately 10% of rows flagged as anomalous by IsolationForest.
- No missing or impossible values, but outliers and anomalies pose risks to modeling robustness.

## Issues
- Moderate outliers in creatinine_phosphokinase (29 outliers)
- Moderate outliers in serum_creatinine (29 outliers)
- Outliers in platelets (21 outliers)
- IsolationForest flagged ~10% of rows as anomalous
