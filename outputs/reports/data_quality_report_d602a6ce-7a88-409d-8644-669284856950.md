# Data Quality Report

**Status:** `WARN`

## Overview
- The dataset contains 299 rows and 13 columns with no missing values or duplicate rows, indicating good completeness.
- Overall data quality is solid, but some columns exhibit outliers and there is a notable fraction of anomalous rows detected.

## Column-level checks
- No missing values were found in any column.
- All columns have appropriate numeric data types.
- Several columns have outliers: creatinine_phosphokinase (29 outliers), platelets (21 outliers), serum_creatinine (29 outliers), ejection_fraction (2 outliers), and serum_sodium (4 outliers).
- No impossible values were detected in any column.

## Row-level anomalies
- IsolationForest anomaly detection flagged approximately 10% of rows as anomalous.
- These anomalies may represent unusual patient profiles or data entry inconsistencies.

## Recommendation
- Proceed with modeling but address the outliers by investigating their clinical plausibility; consider winsorizing or transforming these values if they are errors or extreme but valid.
- Review the anomalous rows to determine if they represent true rare cases or data quality issues; consider excluding or separately modeling these if appropriate.
- Maintain current data types as they are suitable.
- Regular monitoring of outliers and anomalies is recommended to ensure model robustness.

## Issues
- Presence of outliers in multiple numeric columns (creatinine_phosphokinase, platelets, serum_creatinine, ejection_fraction, serum_sodium).
- Approximately 10% of rows flagged as anomalous by IsolationForest.


## Issues
- Outliers detected in creatinine_phosphokinase, platelets, serum_creatinine, ejection_fraction, and serum_sodium columns.
- Approximately 10% of rows flagged as anomalous by IsolationForest anomaly detection.
