# Heart Failure Mortality Prediction Model Summary

## Executive Summary

This model predicts the likelihood of death (DEATH_EVENT) in patients with heart failure using clinical and demographic features. It demonstrates good discriminative ability with an AUC of 0.86 and solid overall accuracy of 82%. The input data is generally complete and well-structured, but some outliers and anomalies warrant caution when interpreting predictions.

## Performance

- **AUC:** 0.859
- **Accuracy:** 0.817
- **F1 score (positive class):** 0.667

The model achieves strong discrimination between patients who survive and those who experience death events, as reflected by the AUC near 0.86. Accuracy above 80% indicates reliable overall classification, while the F1 score of 0.67 shows balanced performance in identifying positive cases despite some class imbalance. These metrics suggest the model is effective but not perfect, especially in correctly identifying all death events.

## Feature Importance

Feature importance is based on SHAP values, which quantify each feature's contribution to the model's predictions. The most influential feature is 'time,' indicating that longer follow-up times strongly affect risk predictions. Next, lower 'ejection_fraction' values increase mortality risk, reflecting poorer heart function. Elevated 'serum_creatinine' levels, indicating kidney function impairment, also raise risk. Older 'age' and presence of 'diabetes' further contribute to higher predicted mortality. Other features like 'sex,' 'creatinine_phosphokinase,' 'serum_sodium,' 'smoking,' and 'platelets' have smaller but notable effects.

## Data Quality Considerations

The upstream data quality status is WARN due to the presence of outliers and anomalies. Specifically, several numeric features such as creatinine_phosphokinase, platelets, serum_creatinine, ejection_fraction, and serum_sodium contain outliers. Additionally, about 10% of rows were flagged as anomalous by IsolationForest, which may represent unusual patient profiles or data inconsistencies. While there are no missing or impossible values, these issues could affect model trustworthiness and generalizability if not addressed.

## Recommendations

It is recommended to carefully review and possibly transform or winsorize outliers to reduce their impact on predictions. Investigate anomalous rows to determine if they represent true rare cases or data errors; consider excluding or modeling them separately if needed. Continuous monitoring of data quality is important to maintain model robustness. Clinicians should interpret predictions in the context of these data limitations and consider the model as a decision support tool rather than a definitive predictor.
